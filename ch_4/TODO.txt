Chapter 4 Todo List
-------------------
* Need to better understand time in go and
  how to determine differences (1 month ago, 1 week ago, etc)
    Look at time.Since()
* For comment creation, do the following:
  Create hidden file .commit_edit
  Use editor to edit that file (how to run vim from a go program?)
  Read that file and send that as response body
  look at os/exec
* Could write a small server that takes a list of ones movies
  and provides a pretty view of them (!)
* file IO is not present in the book...
